701,2022-10-04 13:36:34+00:00,Gidikim,Absent such a policy then the only way to generate revenue to cover their overheads would be to sell GMO seeds that can't be replanted after a harvest. It may sound unfair to farmers but how else can it be fair to the patent holders? Farmers can't reap where they did not sow.
702,2022-10-04 13:36:31+00:00,Gidikim,"This is the real problem with GMO crops. Private companies have to infringe on a  farmer's ""seed sovereignty"" to recoup their investment. The dependency on private companies for every year's planting seed is a form of ""renting intellectual property""."

706,2022-10-04 13:35:55+00:00,Gidikim,"Funny how many GMO opponents cite the ""playing God"" mantra as the reason to be skeptical of GMOs and yet the father of Genetic science Gregory Mendel was himself a man of God. We never call humans Gods when they domesticate aggression out of animals."
707,2022-10-04 13:35:53+00:00,Gidikim,"Otherwise, if we're being honest, human beings have selectively breeded for traits that are not ""natural"" in many crops and animals. The only difference with GMO is the manner of selecting the traits. We really are just continuing Mendel's (God's) work."
708,2022-10-04 13:35:50+00:00,Gidikim,And as for food safety and general skepticism on GMO it's now time for Agricultural Authority to put in place measures for traceability and correct labeling so that consumers who insist on eating only conventional/indegenous foods can consciously make that decision.
